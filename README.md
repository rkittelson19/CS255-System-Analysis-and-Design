# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was submitted by Liam who wanted to do a better job of helping educate students on how to prepare for their driving test. The system would allow customers to setup on-the-road training appointments as well as taking practice tests online to better prepare for their test. They wanted to design a web-based application that could be accessed by multiple devices.

What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well with the UML diagrams as well as determing the functional and nonfunctional requirements. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part to revise, I would work to strengthen the section on assumptions. I would like to do more research on what types of assumptions are typically found in these types of projects.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpret the user's needs and implemented them into the system design by implementing use cases. It's important to consider the user's needs because they are the one ultimately that this application is for. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach desiging software by first collection all requirements, and then documenting them down and creating diagrams to help me visualize the process. After all of that is done, I then work on coding the program. In the future, I will continue to utilize all types of UML diagrams because they have been very helpful for me in understanding systems better.
